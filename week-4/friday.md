For today's warm up, spend some time reviewing your classmates project 1 code!

Take a moment to reflect; you all just started a few weeks ago, and now you are your own source of code to review and learn from!!!

Here's all almost all of your git repos. Don't see yours on there? Please slack Alex right now and he'll add it! (this was done a wee bit last minute).

## Instructions:

1. Pick one repo you want to learn from.
2. Focus on the JS. Go to the/a JS file and click RAW to see the raw code.
3. Copy that into your text editor. 
4. Go through it line by line, make comments and notes to yourself, jot down questions you have for the author and things you want to look up!
5. Make one complete pass through the code before you look anything up or ask them questions. 
6. Look stuff up, slack questions on the WDI-TX-13 slack to the author (so we can all learn together)!

#### Looking ahead:

A stretch goal for this weekend's homework is for you to make your first contribution to open source code! One of your classmates project 1!

Keep this in mind as you review code.
