# Thursday Warm Up

Take a look at [this open source ToDo App](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/examples/jquery/js/app.js) written in jQuery! It's a bit advanced, which is what we are looking for. 

For todays warm up, copy the JavaScript from this file onto a file of your own, and work your way through it line-by-line, writing the best comments you can about what each segment of code is doing. 

In the last 10 minutes of warm ups, answer the following questions as a response to this prompt: 

1. What, if anything, did you learn from this exercise?
2. What do you like about how this code is written?
3. What don't you like?
