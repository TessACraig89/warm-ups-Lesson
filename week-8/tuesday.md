# Warm Up!

## This warm up will be a bit like a Whiteboard Weds, but instead of just whiteboarding, pseudocode your problem, and then code it out and run the code. 


#### The Problem:

Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2]. 

**Bonus:** Try solving this without creating a copy of the list. How many swap or move operations do you need?
