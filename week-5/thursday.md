# Warm Up!

## For this warm up, you will work off of the code base from Monday's live code. 

#### Set up: 

1. You should have already forked and cloned this repo: 
https://git.generalassemb.ly/WDIplus-ATX/express-full-crud/tree/demo

2. Next checkout into the Demo branch, which contains all of the work from the live code. 

`git checkout demo`

3. Open the code in your text editor, and start Nodemon. 

#### Activity:

For this exercise you are going to *add mongo + mongoose* to this code base! 

You may reference the lessons and labs from Tuesday as well as the [Express JS docs](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html), [Mongoose docs](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html), and [MongoDB docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/).

Mongoose docs will probably be the most helpful of the docs for this exercise. 

*The goal here isn't to get this done, as much as it is to review the steps toward setting up your Express app with a database.*
