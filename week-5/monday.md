# Warm Up

I hope you had a great weekend!

#### For today's warm up, please:
1. Get together with a partner for 15 minutes to review the Express homework. If possible, work with a partner you haven't worked with yet.
2. Look at eachother's code an ask questions about what you see. 
3. As a pair, submit a few questions to Slack that you had about the homework, or about Node and Express in general
4. After this 15 minute exercise, continue working on your own on this homework repo. 

Today we add forms to our Express Apps and see full CRUD for the first time!
