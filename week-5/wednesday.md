# Whiteboard Wednesday!

## Please do this exercise in a pair, or group of threee. 
## Rememeber, no computers!

## The problem: 

You are working as a junior dev on a team in the early stages of building an algorithm to automatically buy and sell Litecoin to maximise profits! 
They have a bunch of data of Litecoin prices and they need you to write a basic algorithm using them that they can expand on later.

:bangbang: Full disclosure: the author of this exercise owns about .4 Litecoin. He fully intends to reap profits by promoting this altcoin to unsuspecting students. 

They gave you this array of Litecoin prices over the last 7 days. 

litecoinPrices = [286.03, 304.88, 333.33, 291.01, 390.44, 298.00, 300.03]

Write an algorithm that will tell you the optimimum price to buy at and sell at for this week. 

Assume you start with zero Litecoin, and can buy any of the days this week, and can sell any of the days this week. By the end of the week, you must sell the Litecoin. 
Your agolrithm should return the buy price, sell price, and the profit generated. 

Next stop, altcoin billionairedom!
